Given your task, it would be a good idea to break it down into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time. Here's a suggested step-by-step process:

A. Familiarize Yourself with the Required Libraries and Modules

Understand how to use libraries like OpenCV and PyAutoGUI. There are plenty of tutorials and official documentation online to get started.

B. Capture the Screen's Image

First, learn how to grab screenshots in Python. Use the Pillow library (PIL fork) or pyautogui.screenshot() function to grab a screenshot and save it to a file.

C. Recognize the Symbol/Circle

Once you can take a screenshot, identify the circle in that screenshot using OpenCV. You can investigate OpenCV's Hough Circle Transform.



Example:

python
Copy code
import cv2
import numpy as np

img = cv2.imread('circles.jpg',0)
img = cv2.medianBlur(img,5)
cimg = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)

circles = cv2.HoughCircles(img,cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT,1,20,param1=50,param2=30,minRadius=0,maxRadius=0)

circles = np.uint16(np.around(circles))
for i in circles[0,:]:
    # draw the outer circle
    cv2.circle(cimg,(i[0],i[1]),i[2],(0,255,0),2)
    # draw the center of the circle
    cv2.circle(cimg,(i[0],i[1]),2,(0,0,255),3)

cv2.imshow('detected circles',cimg)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()



D. Detect the Colored Section

You can use color detection methods in OpenCV to detect your colored section within the recognized circle.

E. Track the Dial within the Circle

You'll need to employ a method to track the dial - could be edge detection/methods like Template Matching/Feature Matching in OpenCV.

F. Determine Intersection

Once you've identified the circle, the colored segment, and the dial motion, create a function to determine when the dial intersects with the colored area.

G. Trigger Keyboard Inputs

Finally, once you're able to accurately detect when the dial overlaps with the colored area, use PyAutoGUI to simulate the desired keyboard pressing actions.

H. Optimization

Remember to optimize each stage and ensure that the entire process runs efficiently to be able to track the motion of the dial in real-time.

As you progress through each of the steps, be sure to verify each part individually as it will be easier to locate and fix errors. It's a complex project and requires a good understanding of image processing, CV, and Python programming. But don't hesitate, start step by step, and you'll certainly make it. Good luck!
